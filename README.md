# rspec-cheat-sheet

## Objective

Setting up RSpec tests to support Test Driven Development. 

## Implementation

Our tests were created first in order to break down the finished product and then code was written to past the test. This code was then refactored.

## Fizzbuzz
This consists of printing out numbers 1 to 100. If a nnumber is divisible by 3 then 'Fizz' is printed, if divisible by 5 'Buzz' is printed and if divisible by both then 'Fizzbuzz' is printed instead of the number.

This was created in a class which was instanstiated in order to be used in our rspec test. A before hook would be useful for future implementation.

## Calculator
A basic calculator was created with methods to add two numbers. The total of these numbers were tested using our rspec tests.
